# cheatsheet.nvim

A searchable cheatsheet for neovim from within the editor using
[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
(fallback to displaying in a floating window if Telescope is not
installed), because hoomans suck at remembering stuff:

![cheatsheet.nvim with Telescope](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23398472/120632733-e6191f80-c486-11eb-90d6-e26bacf83c20.png)

<sup>Font: [mononoki](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/), Colorscheme: [onedark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim), [Dotfiles](https://github.com/sudormrfbin/dotfiles2)</sup>

## Quickstart

1. Forget how to do `X`
2. Hit `<leader>?` to invoke cheatsheet telescope
3. Type in `X` and find forgotten mapping/command
4. No more ???
5. Profit !!

## Installation

Installing Telescope is not required, but *highly* recommended for
using this plugin effectively. `popup.nvim` and `plenary.nvim`
are used by Telescope.

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```viml
Plug 'sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim'
" optional
Plug 'nvim-lua/popup.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
```

Using [dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

```viml
call dein#add('sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim')
" optional
call dein#add('nvim-lua/popup.nvim')
call dein#add('nvim-lua/plenary.nvim')
call dein#add('nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim')
```
Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
  'sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim',
  -- optional
  requires = {
    {'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'},
    {'nvim-lua/popup.nvim'},
    {'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'},
  }
}
```

## Usage

Use the `:Cheatsheet` command which automatically uses Telescope if installed
or falls back to showing all the cheatsheet files concatenated in a floating
window. A default mapping `<leader>?` is provided for `:Cheatsheet` 
(not bound if alerady in use). By default the `<leader>` key is `\`.

Your cheatsheet file is a simple text file with the name `cheatsheet.txt` found in
`~/.config/nvim/` (`~/AppData/Local/nvim/` if you're on Windows) alongside your
`init.vim`. Use the `:CheatsheetEdit` command to open it in a buffer to edit.

| Telescope mappings | Description                                 |
| ---                | ---                                         |
| `<C-E>`            | Edit user cheatsheet Ã  la `:CheatsheetEdit` |
| `<C-Y>`            | Yank the cheatcode                          |
| `Enter`            | Fill in the command line; see below         |

On `Enter`, if the current selection is a command, it will be filled
in the command line as if you had typed it (it won't be executed yet).
Note that it will *stop* filling the command line when it encounters a `{`
or `[`. So if the cheat is `:set textwidth={n}`, your commandline will
have `:set textwidth=` typed into it and the cursor at end.

Since `cheatsheet.nvim` provides it's own commands,  it is not required to
"load" `cheatsheet.nvim` with Telescope which is usually required for plugins
using Telescope.

## Configuration

```lua
local defaults = {
    -- Whether to show bundled cheatsheets

    -- For generic cheatsheets like default, unicode, nerd-fonts, etc
    bundled_cheatsheets = true,
    -- bundled_cheatsheets = {
    --     enabled = {},
    --     disabled = {},
    -- },

    -- For plugin specific cheatsheets
    bundled_plugin_cheatsheets = true,
    -- bundled_plugin_cheatsheets = {
    --     enabled = {},
    --     disabled = {},
    -- }
}
```

`bundled_cheatsheets` and `bundled_plugin_cheatsheets` can also be tables to
have more fine grained control:

```lua
local defaults = {
    bundled_cheatsheets = {
        -- only show the default cheatsheet
        enabled = { "default" },
    },
    bundled_plugin_cheatsheets = {
        -- show cheatsheets for all plugins except gitsigns
        disabled = { "gitsigns.nvim" },
    }
}
```

## `cheatsheet.txt` File Format

- `#` starts a normal comment, blank lines are ignored.
- `##` starts a metadata comment for specifying sections and tags.

    `## section-name @tag1 @tag2`: here `section-name` is the name of a plugin
    or a simple name to group some cheats together. `tag1` and `tag2` are alternative
    names that you might later remember the section name with. For example the section
    name can be [`sandwich`](https://github.com/machakann/vim-sandwich) and the tag
    can be `@surround`.

- A cheat consists of a description and the key/command/anything separated by `|`

    ```
    Open cheatsheet | <leader>?
    Open cheatsheet in floating window | :CheatSheet!

    View mappings | :map [mapping]
    Set text width to {n} | :set tw={n}
    ```

    Like help files, anything in square brackets is `[optional]` and anything
    in curly brackets is `{required}` arguments. Some commands require a
    register or mark or number before them, and they are marked with `{r}`,
    `{m}`, `{n}`, etc. These are not hard and fast rules, simply conventions in
    the default cheatsheet -- you can of course ignore them when writing your
    own cheats (though if you want commands to be presented in the command line
    properly on pressing `Enter`, see the note about it in the Usage section.)

See this project's [cheatsheet](./cheatsheet.txt) and the
[default](./doc/cheatsheet-default.txt) included one for more examples.

## For Plugin Authors

You can put a `cheatsheet.txt` file in the root of your repo
([like](./cheatsheet.txt) in this repo) and it will be picked up automatically
and displayed on `:Cheatsheet`.  You don't have to add the file to your repo
*solely* to support searching it using `cheatsheet.nvim` -- the format is
simple enough to be opened and read normally and can serve as a great
quickstart for users.

## Additional Cheatsheets

Cheats for other plugins are collected in [contrib](./contrib/cheatsheet.txt). Ideally
plugin authors would supply their own `cheatsheet.txt`, but since
that is not possible for every plugin, they are collected here.
You can copy them at your leisure.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin was inspired by (and borrowed some code and the default cheatsheat)
from [cheat40](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-cheat40).
